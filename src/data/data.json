    "aboutDescription": "Hello! I&apos;m Vandit, a budding full-stack web developer based in Toronto, Canada. Since my first coding venture in 8th grade, I&apos;ve been captivated by the world of technology. Armed with a Bachelor in Computer Applications, I&apos;ve honed my skills in the MERN stack, Python, and Java. Currently, I&apos;m expanding my expertise with a focus on Cyber Security at York University. Beyond coding, I find joy in the synergy of design and development. In recent years, I&apos;ve dived into programming, crafting a robust front-end stack, and creating projects that address real-world challenges. Juggling design, development, and education, I am trying to dive deep into coding and make a real difference.  If you&apos;re intrigued by what I&apos;m working on, explore my portfolio below, and let&apos;s connect for potential collaborations!"
